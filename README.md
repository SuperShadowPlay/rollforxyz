### An initiative tracker for DnD 5e

Roll for XYZ is an online initiative tracker designed for use with DnD 5e.
It aims to provide convienent and customizable features to help Dungeon Masters
focus less on keeping track of who's turn it is or what health an enemy has, and
focus more on having fun!

Made with the Vue.js 3 framework

## Project setup

* `npm install` - Install required modules
* `npm run dev` - Run a development preview of the website
* `npm run build` - Build a production-ready image

## TODO:
In no particular order:
- [x] Scrollable and sorted initiative order
- [x] Ability to add creatures to initiative order
- [x] Removable creatures
- [x] Add Github link
- [x] Add satisfying feedback to button presses (submit, next, etc.)
- [x] Add basic color theme
- [ ] Select an arbitrary card as the next in line
- [x] Only begin selecting creatures once the user is done initially adding creatures
- [ ] Next button moves along the page with active card
- [ ] Page scrolls down when active enemy is off screen
- [x] Add metadata
- [ ] Save/load encounters
- [ ] Integrate statblocks (only if legally possible - TBD)
- [ ] Add status checkboxes
- [ ] Add notes on creature
- [ ] Edit creature
- [ ] Roll initiative for you
- [ ] Show actions
- [ ] Icons for creatures
- [ ] Health tracker
- [ ] Cross out defeated enemy
- [ ] Fancy initiative count markers
- [ ] Nice stylesheet and interface (subjective and a bottomless pit of development time)
- [ ] Encounter templates
- [ ] Mass-add same type of creature (option to roll initiative for you)
- [ ] Web-app support
- [ ] Portrait-friendly interface option (landscape is default)
- [ ] Color themes

Who knows what else from there! I want the primary function to be *chefs kiss* perfect before moving on to
other, larger features such as:
- [ ] Prepared stat block area
  - Keep stat blocks at the ready during your encounters
- [ ] Custom stat blocks stored by accounts
